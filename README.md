This is the first commit I've ever made.

Dear future me.
How are you doing there?
Have you achieved what you've dreamed? Maybe some other jobs?
Here 2024, I am challenging to become a better person.
Getting up early, Having healthy meals, Spending time usefully.
These are very hard to continue everyday.
However in a not quite far future I hope for your happiness.
Remu. Maybe your nickname might have changed or whatever, but
I am still cheering you. Keep in mind. No human will wait for you if your lazy.
Follow your dreams until you succeed. Keep working on Remu!
Be proud if you are still coding. Even though you aren't I'll be cheering you.
